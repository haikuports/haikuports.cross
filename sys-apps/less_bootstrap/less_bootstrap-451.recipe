SUMMARY="Less is a free, open-source file pager"
DESCRIPTION="GNU less is a program similar to more, but which allows \
backward movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less \
does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with \
large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi. Less uses \
termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of \
terminals. There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.
